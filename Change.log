Fixes:

* Remove Public from everything except public static void main
* removed all unnecessary classes except for Kite (which is also unnecessary)
* left arraylists, but arrays would be better
* added input checking for numeric input

Problems: 
* what if you do not enter a number from the list? Then the program crashes.
